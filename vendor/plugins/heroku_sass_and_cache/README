HerokuSassAndCache
==================

This plugin will do the following:
- Generate SASS files inside tmp/stylesheets
- If you are combining all your JS and CSS by adding ":cache => true", it will generate the combined file inside tmp/javascript and tmp/stylesheets

The included controller should allow you to access these files like normal. Etags are provided so that Heroku's Varnish caches the files.

I know, the name is terrible. Its not very imaginative.

Make it work
============

Add to config/routes.rb "map.heroku_sass_and_cache"

There is a rake task available to generate the css files:
RAILS_ENV=production rake heroku_sass_and_cache:generate_style_sheets
